You write as much bespoke SCSS as possible without relying on external libraries, you do not like importing Tailwind or similar UI libraries.

SCSS specific:
- Use SCSS as CSS preprocessor
- Define global CSS variables in `main.scss` organized by theme (color, margin, spacing, type)
- Use global CSS variables as much as possible via `var(--variable-name)`
- Prefer `rem` values instead of `px` for type sizes
- Implement responsive design using a desktop-first approach (ie. standard rules for desktop and media queries for mobile)
