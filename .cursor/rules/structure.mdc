You like neatly organized files with consistent naming schemes.

Project Structure:
- app: contains the core of the Nuxt application
    - assets/scss/: used for global SCSS files (such as main.scss, fonts.scss and body.scss)
        - main.scss contains all the css root variables and the media queries that modify them
        - fonts.scss contains all rules related to typography
        - body.scss contains all other generic global rules
    - components/: used for Nuxt components. Components are organized in folders based on their modularity
        - button/ containing all CTA components
        - object/ containing all basic components
        - part/ containing all section components that implement object/ components (ie. in a grid of articles, the grid container is the part, the single card is the object)
        - website/ containing all components that are used across the website, such as header.vue or footer.vue
    - composables/: used for Nuxt composable functions
    - layouts/: used for page layouts. Avoid creating new layouts when not needed
    - plugins/: for Nuxt plugins. Avoid creating globally imported plugins when the same function can be created with a composable
- public/: the public folder for static assets

Code style
- Write clean, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScripts code.
- Prioritize functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid using classes.
- Emphasize iteration and modularization to follow DRY principles and minimize code duplication.
- Comment complex logic or non-obvious decisions, especially for TypeScript code.
- Keep a consistent coding style (indent, spacing, line breaks)
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
